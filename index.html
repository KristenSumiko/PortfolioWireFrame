        <section class="myBio">
            <p>My name is Kristen.  I am a student in Thinkful’s Software Engineering program.  My background is in cosmetology and hospitality.  That experience helps with my attention to detail in coding, not just functionality, but also the look and feel of projects.  I have dreamt about a career in technology, and though I took a few detours, I am excited to finally do work that could impact people for years to come.  The coding of apps/websites enhances lives on a daily basis.  I am excited to be a part of that.  Stellar customer service is at the core of everything I do professionally.  That has transferred from making sure clients leave salon visits happy, to making sure guests leave hotel stays happy, and now making sure website/app users have easy and enjoyable experiences.</p>
            <p>I am currently based in Brooklyn, New York.  I enjoy spicy foods, stiff drinks, tropical settings, and good music.  I am happy when I’m out and about in good company, or just home binge-watching TV shows and eating microwave popcorn.  Last but not least, I like to leave a good impression on people.  If I can’t do that with an in-person encounter, then I at least like to do it with my work.</p>
